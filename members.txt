Michael Horenstein: I wrote the description of the application and helped refine the E/R diagram deciding what was essential and what needed to be connected. I also helped with the list of database tables and what attributes should be keys. Like everyone else in the group, I helped formulate the idea of the project. Most importantly, I built the massive database we used for our tables using a python Jupyter Notebook combining some information from the Duke API and some information from assumptions. It took me a very long time to get the data and generate pseudo values for what classes people take, tutor, ta etc. I have put this data into CSV files that others are turned into SQL files. A more in depth of my termenology for how I did this is found in the Final Report and the notebook itself in zipped form with accompanying files is in this folder.

Gray Perrone: I brainstormed and wrote more premade SQL queries. These queries can easily be incorporated into the website and adds interesting information for the user to get from our website that will help them pick courses, find TAs and fellow classmates. I also helped Adam on the Website Description document and outlining what the website will look like and how an user will go through it.

Adam Davidovich: I created the overall website design. This includes what pages we will have as a part of our website, what information is displayed on each of those pages, and how each page interacts with one another as well as how the user interacts with each page. On top of this, I have written the code to load our large database into SQL and helped with the creation and design of the premade SQL queries.

Daniel Bass-Blue: I helped manage the project's outline and distributed roles accordingly. I put in input on the description of the application. Began wireframing the UI of the application and iterating on design. Additionally, we are looking to design the user imput portal for courses they have taken when signing up.

Ted Marchildon: I built out the web app in its entirety. I made the database interactive so the user can both view their information and update their information. I tried to make access points to the database easy, so that the users have a good experience. I deployed the app on the google vm, and integrated the postgres database with the web server, and the web server with the browser. Learned a lot and really enjoyed it!
